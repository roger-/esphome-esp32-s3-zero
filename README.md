# ESPHome configuration for ESP32-S3 Zero boards
S3 Zero boards ([Waveshare branded](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Zero) and clones) need some extra configuration to work properly with ESPHome. 

See the yaml file for an example, including:

* board configuration
* fixing the WiFi auth error that prevents the device from connecting to WiFi
* support for the WS2812 RGB LED
